Everybody has a price?, so, What's your price?. Strong and ancient differences between two distant-neighbor countries are discussed under each opinion. Both Mexican and American-common persons give its particular point of view about the other, but also about themselves. Developed with a extremely low budget, but with inventive and imagination, this movie shows many of the key aspects in the Mexican-American relationship. However, the movie is not just a compilation of statistics, the producers manage to make it fun too. That's one of it's good points. But never the only one.

      "Overview : Though gay-themed stories about \"coming out\" and accepting one's sexuality are not uncommon in Western countries, such tales are still rare in many conservative African nations. Considered a ground-breaking film in its native Guinea, and filmed amidst a storm of controversy, Mohamed Camara's Dakan is the first of its nations films to directly address issues surrounding homosexuality. The story centers on the romance between two 20-year-old men, Manga and Sory who are first seen making out in a car. The trouble begins when Manga tells his widowed mother about his love for Sory, who is busy contending with his outraged father. The parents insist that the two never see each other again. Manga's mother then uses witchcraft to cleanse her son and change him into a heterosexual. Time passes and eventually Manga begins to date a girl. But it soon becomes apparent that try as he might, Manga's heart belongs to Sory.\n",
